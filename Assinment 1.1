Assingment 1.1

1. Say True or False for the below statements:
â€¢ Prescriptive Analytics used to predict the future outcomes?
   False
â€¢ Base R packages installed automatically? 
	True
	
2. What is Recycling of elements in a vector?
	When applying an operation to two vectors that requires them to be the same length, R automatically recycles,
	or repeats, elements of the shorter one, until it is long enough to match the longer Vector.

3. Give an example of recycling of elements.
	Suppose we have two Vectors c(1,2,4) , c(6,0,9,10,13), where the first one is shorter with only 3 elements. 
	Now if we sum these two,
	ex:a>c(1,2,4)
	   b>c(6,0,9,10,13)
	   d>a+b
	   output 
	   (7,2,13,11,15)
